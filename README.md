# About the Franconian Data Science League

The Franconian Data Science League is a series of one-day Hackathons. What is different from the classical hackathon concept is that there is only one problem proposed by a hosting company with a specific metric to optimise (i.e. F1 Score or RMSE). This ensures that the objectively best solution is the winner rather than the best pitch.
