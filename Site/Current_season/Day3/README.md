# Current Season: Day 3

On the third day of the news season NielsenIQ at GfK - An NIQ Compan hosts an exciting machine learning challenge in the context of customer credits.

Thank you Jeff from GFK for designing such an innovative challenge, that seemed to be easy at the beginning, but revealed its hardness throughout the day.

# More Info on the Problem
*NIQ Waj¬¥kanda* needs your help. The villain ‚ÄúDe Danos‚Äù hinders Vibranium Glide, the
biggest retailer of hoverboards, to deliver us sales data, which will challenge the
accuracy of our reporting. However, other retailers are not affected by this iniquity and
continue to send their data.
You have been selected to be part of a taskforce in charge of modelling Vibranium
Glide's monthly sales after they stopped their regular data deliveries. To help in this
process you will have access to the full history of Vibranium Glide's sales, alongside
historical (for training) and still ongoing (for inference) data deliveries from its four main
competitors: Panther Hover, Wakanda Wheels, Shuri's Skates and HoverTech Wakanda.
These data report for each retailer the monthly sales of all known models of hoverboard.
The final delivery will be simulation of Vibranium Glide's hoverboard sales at various
horizons in a scheme that mimics real-time and prevents look ahead bias:
- Month t, i.e. the first month after delivery stopped. This prediction will have to be
submitted by 3pm.
- Months t+1 and t+2, i.e. the two following months. You will get the necessary
data of the competitors and submission template after handing in predictions for
Month t. This prediction will have to be submitted by 4pm.
- Months t+3, t+4 and t+5, i.e. the three following months. You will get the
necessary data of the competitors and submission template after handing in
predictions for Months t+1 and t+2. This prediction will have to be submitted by
5pm.
This time we will not provide explicit feedback on predictions but you can choose to use
the last months of training data as validation sets as demoed in the provided evaluation
notebook (see below for available data and resources).
From a methodological point of view, this exercise is a hierarchical time series
modelling and prediction problem (e.g. see this article on Medium
https://medium.com/data-science/a-simple-approach-to-hierarchical-time-series-
forecasting-with-machine-learning-2e180d83966c). Therefore, simulations will be
evaluated in terms of sales units per model, brand and overall.

# Results

We‚Äôre thrilled to announce that *NKD Group* has won the third matchday of this season, hosted by NielsenIQ at GfK - An NIQ Company. The task was out of the comfort zone of most participants and pushed each team to explore new approaches in time-series analyses and forecasting.

A huge congratulations to the team from NKD Group for their remarkable performance! üéâ
